								<b>Project I : Building a data pipeline based on the Methane emissions data from the WorldBank API.</b>  
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/data_pipeline.png" alt=""/>
								</span>
								<p>In this project, I build a data pipeline using python. the project consists in creating a RestAPI (FastAPI) with a specific endpoint that will be able to return the Methane emissions for a country at a specific year.</p>

								The project includes the following steps:

								<ol>
									<li>Data retrieval: Using a Python script to retrieve methane emission data from the World Bank API using the WBGAPI module.</li>
									<li>Data estimation: Using various methods such as rolling statistical, KNNImputer, and linear interpolation to estimate missing methane emission data.</li>
									<li>Uncertainty computation: Using the bootstrapping method to calculate the uncertainty of the estimated values.</li>
									<li>Scoring methodology: Evaluating countries based on their methane emissions using various methods such as total emissions, emissions per area, emissions per capita, and emission intensity.
									<li>Data visualization: Creating interactive visualizations using the power BI to present the results.
									<li>REST API (FastAPI) to return the Methane emissions for a country at a specific year.

								<b>Project II : Premier league predictions</b><br>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/pl.png" alt=""/>
								</span>
								
								<p>In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict the score of Premier League matches. For this we have data from the last 3 seasons.</p>
								The project includes the following steps :
								
								<ol>
									<li>Data retrieval: Using a Python script to scrape premier league matches data from this website <a href="https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats"><b>here</b></a></li>
									<li>Preprocessing: Using right data types to optimize the memory used of the data and performing cleaning data.</li>
									<li>Modelisation: Using machine learning model especially RandomForestClassifier. We trained the model first and predict the result of future matches.</li>
									<li>First Evaluation: Compute the precision score of the prediction of the model.
									<li>Improving the precision: Creating new features by performing rolling average.
									<li>Last evaluation: Compute again the precision score of the prediction of the model improved.
								</ol>
